Hey everyone, Scro11z here again diving into how we’ve turned radio frequencies into some seriously powerful tools, both on the battlefield and behind the scenes.

Turns out, once humans figured out how to harness electromagnetic waves, it didn’t take long to weaponize them. Kinda in our nature, right? But seriously modern RF tech is wild. Let’s break it down.

### RF Weapons: From Microwaves to Crowd Control

We’re not talking sci-fi anymore these systems are real, deployed, and changing warfare.

- **CHAMP**  This isn’t your average missile. It flies over a target and fires bursts of microwaves that fry electronics  servers, drones, command centers  without blowing anything up. Tested successfully, and the best part? It leaves buildings intact and people unharmed. Silent, surgical, and scary effective.

- **THOR**  Short for *Tactical High-power Operational Responder*, this truck-mounted system is built to stop drone swarms. With 360° coverage and setup in under three hours, it’s designed for rapid response. One shot, multiple drones  gone.

- **RapidDestroyer**  The UK’s answer to cheap, efficient defense. For less than **13¢ per shot**, it takes out UAVs with pinpoint microwave strikes. Compare that to million-dollar missiles, and it’s a no-brainer. Automation means one operator can run the whole show.

- **Active Denial System (ADS)**  Ever feel like your skin’s on fire… but it isn’t? That’s ADS. At **95 GHz**, it shoots millimeter waves that heat the top layer of skin (just 1/64 inch deep)  unbearable, but safe. Used for crowd control up to **700 meters** away. Non-lethal, but *very* persuasive.

### Surveillance & Privacy

RF isn’t just for weapons it’s everywhere in surveillance, often flying under the radar.

#### Stingrays (IMSI Catchers)
These are *cell tower mimics*. Your phone connects to the strongest signal and guess what? Stingrays pretend to be legit towers.

- They grab your IMSI number, track your location, and in some cases, can intercept calls or even inject malware.
- Even with 4G/5G encryption, there are cracks: IMSI numbers show up *before* authentication. Some 5G identifiers can be decrypted especially if your carrier gets a government request.
- Research from Purdue and the University of Iowa shows ways to guess IMSI numbers *without* decryption. So yeah, your privacy isn’t as safe as you think.

They’ve been spotted near airports, immigration offices, and protest zones but don’t expect agencies to admit it. NDAs keep most of this in the dark.

#### Drones 
UAVs aren’t just for delivery some are packing RF sniffers and jammers.

- They detect drones by their control signals (like 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz), track flight paths, and even locate the pilot using timing tricks like TDoA.
- Devices like the **CRFS LW Node** (under 2 kg) can be mounted on drones for high-altitude spectrum monitoring way better line of sight, wider reach.
- And some carry Stingray-like tech, scooping up cell data during low flights. Imagine a drone hovering over a protest, silently vacuuming phone data. That’s not paranoia  it’s possible.

Officially, these are for counter-drone ops and border security. But the potential for abuse? Huge.

So yeah RF tech is everywhere. It can knock out a missile, disperse a crowd, or track your every move. The future’s here… and it’s *invisible*.
