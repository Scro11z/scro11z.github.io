Alright, so logging into Bandit 11

We see we're dealing with more data. 

Here are the specifications: "All lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions"

So this one's definitely more difficult than before. 

Since all the letters have been rotated by 13 positions, it sounds like we're dealing with more of a cipher. 

More specifically, the ROT13 cipher, which replaces each letter with the 13th letter after it

It seems like in order to decode it, we will need to use the tr command (translate command). 

Okay, so with this particular cipher, they translated the standard alphabet set (A-Z and a-z)

to a different set with a 13-letter offset, which looks like

this set (N-Z and n-z)

So A-Z and a-z == N-Z and n-z in this case, so using the translate command, we will 

Tell it to map each letter back to its unrotated letter.

So first, we'll cat the data and pipe the output into the translate command and map the two sets together, which looks like

cat data.txt | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'

which will give us the flag

BANDIT 12

Okay, apparently the password is stored in the file data.txt, and it's a hexdump file that has undergone numerous compressions 

Anyway, so what seems to need to be done is we need to create a directory to work in (which it's saying to do in temp, probably to leave no trace) 

so using the mktemp -d command (making a directory in the temp folder)

After making that directory, we need to move there to work there, so changing directories with cd lets us move there.

Now we can copy the data file to this directory (we have more permissions in this directory).

Using the copy command (cp), we can cp ~/data.txt . (which copies it to the current directory we are in)

then lets rename the data.txt file to a new file named hexdump using the move command (mv)

mv data.txt hexdump

then we need to dump the contents into a new file and work from there

Using the xxd command with the -r flag, we can reverse the hexdump into a new file

When we get the data, it looks scrambled (probably because it's compressed)

Okay, now here's the fun part. So in the hexdump file it tells us the signature of the type of compression method that was used in the header, so using head we see 1f8b 08

which means it's gzip compressed

For gzip compressed files, the header is \x1F\x8B\x08.

In order to decompress, we need to make the data file a gzip file (that's because it's compressed into a gzip file, so we change the name to data.gz using the mv file) via

mv data data.gz

then decompress it using gzip -d

But when we read it, we notice that the file is not fully decompressed, so doing the same thing we did before, we will

xxd the file, and the first few bytes that pop up is a bz2 file.

When looking up 425a 68, we see it's a bzip file version 2

So we change it to a bzip2 file and then decompress it again.

Mv data data.bz2

Then we cat it and noticed it's still compressed, so let's read the hex version of it again.

xxd data

first few bytes we see is 1f8b 08

which is another gzip file

oooo were getting close lol

lets do it again

what we get is a endless abyss of code lol no worries

instead do xxd data | head (head only prints the first 10 lines of code)

and when we use the command file on the file we see its a tar archive

so we change the file to a tar file and extract it using tar -xf (file)

when we list we get out a file called data5.bin

so we extract the bin file again

and we get data6.bin lets read the header 

another bzip 2 file

so when we convert it and decompress it we get another tar archive (i know because i used the file command)

now we get a data8.bin file which is a gzipped compressed file now lets decompress it

AND AFTER A CENTURY WE FINALLY GOT THE FLAG
