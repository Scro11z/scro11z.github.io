Okay so after you managed to get the flag from the previous level you can use that to login to the user bandit1

once logged in we can give a list command (ls) and we see a file thats named "-"

you cant traditionally access that file with cat using normal means what you need to do is

cat that file by using the command

cat ./-

when using "./" in this case we are telling the machine to cat the file named "-" in this current directory (so it doesnt mistake the dash as a flag)

once the file is read we get another password and can move to level 2
