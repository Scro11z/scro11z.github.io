BANDIT 0

in order to get past bandit0 the only knowledge you need is how to use cat and ssh

when SSH'ing into any machine first you have to get  username (in this case bandit0) and you'll need the server (in this case bandit.labs.overthewire.com) and the port in order to specify the port you need to use the -p flag and then the port number (2220) in this case

so it'll look like this

template: (username)@(server) -p (port) 

for this level it is 

bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

The password is bandit0 to login

once in the server a simple ls command shows all the files in the directory

ls means to list

and you will see a readme file, and in order to read it you need the cat command

so you do cat (filename) which is readme in this case and boom you'll get the flag


BANDIT 1


Okay so after you managed to get the flag from the previous level you can use that to login to the user bandit1

once logged in we can give a list command (ls) and we see a file thats named "-"

you cant traditionally access that file with cat using normal means what you need to do is

cat that file by using the command

cat ./-

when using "./" in this case we are telling the machine to cat the file named "-" in this current directory (so it doesnt mistake the dash as a flag)

once the file is read we get another password and can move to level 2
