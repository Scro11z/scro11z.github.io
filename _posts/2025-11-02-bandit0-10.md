AI WAS USED FOR FORMATTING NOT CONTENT THANK YOU

## BANDIT 0

To begin Bandit 0, use SSH to connect to the server.  
You’ll need:
- Username: `bandit0`
- Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Port: `2220` (specified with the `-p` flag)

Connect using:
```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

The password is `bandit0`.

Once logged in, list the files in the directory with:
```bash
ls
```

You’ll see a file named `readme`. Read it using:
```bash
cat readme
```

This displays the flag, which is the password for **Bandit 1**.

---

## BANDIT 1

After obtaining the flag from Bandit 0, log in as `bandit1` using the same SSH command with the new password.

Run `ls` to list files—you’ll see a file named `-`.

This is a special filename that can’t be read directly with `cat -` because the dash is interpreted as standard input.

Instead, use:
```bash
cat ./-
```

The `./` tells the shell to treat it as a file path, allowing you to read the file and get the next flag.

---

## BANDIT 2

Log in to **Bandit 2** using the flag from the previous level.

You’ll find a file named `spaces in this filename`.

To read it, escape the spaces with backslashes:
```bash
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```

Alternatively, use tab completion or wrap the name in quotes:
```bash
cat "spaces in this filename"
```

This outputs the flag for **Bandit 3**.

---

## BANDIT 3

Log in and run:
```bash
cd inhere
ls
```

No files appear—because the target file is hidden.

Use:
```bash
ls -al
```

You’ll see a hidden file named `.hidden`. Read it with:
```bash
cat .hidden
```

Retrieve the flag and proceed to **Bandit 4**.

---

## BANDIT 4

Enter the `inhere` directory and list the files—you’ll see many.

The challenge states:  
> "The password is in the only human-readable file."

Use `find` with `file` and `grep`:
```bash
find . -type f -exec file {} \; | grep text
```

This reveals `file07` as the readable file. Read it:
```bash
cat file07
```

Get the flag and move to **Bandit 5**.

---

## BANDIT 5

Inside `inhere`, you’ll find many directories and files.

The file we need is:
- Human-readable
- Exactly **1033 bytes**
- **Not executable**

Use:
```bash
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} \; | grep text
```

This identifies the correct file (e.g., `.file2` in `maybehere07`). Read it:
```bash
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
```

Retrieve the flag.
